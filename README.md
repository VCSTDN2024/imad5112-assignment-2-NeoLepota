Project

The True or False app is a mobile application developed as part of an assignment in the IMAD5112. This application was created using "Kotlin** and android Studio**. The app's primary purpose is to answer questions given and answer whether its true or false.

The app was developed to meet the requirements of the assignment, which includes creating a functional mobile app and utilizing GitHub for version control and CI/CD automation using GitHub Actions.

2. It response with correct or incorrect with a the colour green for correct and red for incorrect.

## GitHub and GitHub Actions
  
This project was managed using **GitHub** for version control, where all code changes were committed and pushed regularly. GitHub enabled collaborative coding, allowing me to keep track of changes and maintain project integrity.

### GitHub Actions:
I utilized **GitHub Actions** to automate the build and deployment process. This includes:

- Running automated **tests** to ensure the appâ€™s functionality.
- Compiling the app into **APK** and **AAB** files, which are the formats required for distribution.
- Uploading these build artifacts to GitHub for easy access.

The workflow ensures that my project is automatically built and tested every time I push changes, and it simplifies the process of delivering the final APK/AAB files for submission.
